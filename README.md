Welcome to the Joyner Document Format official LaTeX class.
This class was written and tested using a default MacTeX installation,
so it should work out of the box
as long as youâ€™re running an up-to-date LaTeX distribution.

## Quick start

You can clone this repo and try typesetting `jdf-starter.tex`
with the following commands:

    biber jdf-starter
    pdflatex jdf-starter

The result should look like `jdf-starter.pdf`.
* `biber` command generates used referenes from `references.bib` 
* `pdflatex` command generates the final pdf 

### Pandoc

#### Requirements

* Updated to work with `pandoc 2.14.0.2` (other versions may work, no guarantees)
* A current LaTeX distribution with appropriate packages.
  * `tabularx` is required.

#### Using Pandoc

* A `Makefile` has been included to produce the document.

```shell
# To generate the report, execute the following command from the commandline:
make
```
* A customized `apa.csl` citation stylesheet has been included for 
enumerating the reference list.
* The `jdf-template.pandoc` has been updated to address new `CSLReferences[2]`
syntax and add `tabularx` package.
* Table formatting has been broken, for anything other than simple tables,
using LaTeX directly in the pandoc file is recommended.
* The example markdown file which can be edited is called `project_report.md`.
* The output file is a pdf called `project_report.pdf`.
* Working files are stored in `out` and can be ignored. They may be useful
for troubleshooting.
* To remove publisher information from the reference list, change the
`--csl=apa-6th-edition-numbered.csl` to `--csl=apa.csl` in the `Makefile`.
APA 7th edition removed the publisher info
